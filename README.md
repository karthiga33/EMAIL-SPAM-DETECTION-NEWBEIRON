# EMAIL-SPAM-DETECTION-NEWBEIRON

OBJECTIVE:

      Email spam detection is important for protecting users from unwanted emails that can contain malicious links or attachments. 
      It helps to prevent phishing attacks, malware distribution, and other fraudulent activities. 
      By detecting and blocking spam emails, email providers can ensure that their users have a safe and secure email experience.

IMPORTING LIBRARIES:

      Importing the libraries are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, 
      seaborn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
      and SVC classifiers

UPLoading the csv file:

      Uploading the csv file using pandas library and read the csv file

      To check the Shape , info , and description of the csv file

PERFORMING EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:

       To check the null values of given datasets

       Drop the null values of given datasets

       To check the dupicates of the given datasets and remove that

       plot the spam and ham categories using countplot

ENCODE THE DATASET:

       Encode the label colunm of given dataset using Label Encoding

MODEL FITTING:

        Split the X tran and y train and fit the models are
        Logistic regression, random forest, decision tree classifier, SVC

BALANCING THE DATA:

        The given datas are imbalance , so we balance the datas using over_Sampling method

MODEL BUILDING:

         Comparing to the r2 score in different classification methods,
          Logistic Regression will works on best

CONCLUSION:

         The above msg all models have been able to tell that the message is spam
